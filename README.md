## 📄 Description

In this project, I have performed the following tasks:

1. **Data Loading and Cleaning**: 
   - Converted rating and price columns to numeric format.
   - Removed currency symbols and converted prices to euros.
   - Dropped unnecessary columns and duplicate records.

2. **Data Transformation**:
   - Split categories into subcategories for more detailed analysis.

3. **Analysis and Visualization**:
   - Identified categories with the highest prices.
   - Analyzed the correlation between rating and price.
